[00:09.68] I used to think that this was my town
[00:12.81] What a stupid thing to think
[00:15.20] I hear you're fighting off a breakdown
[00:17.59] I myself am on the break
[00:29.59] 
[00:20.70] I used to want to be a real man
[00:23.11] I don't know what that even means
[00:25.36] Now I just want you in my arms again
[00:28.66] And we can search each other's dreams
[00:47.16] 
[00:33.19] I know you're tired
[00:35.34] And you ain't sleeping well
[00:38.34] Uninspired
[00:40.51] And likely mad as hell
[00:44.02] But wherever you are
[00:46.08] I hope the high road leads you home again
[01:06.58] 
[00:52.54] I heard enough of the white man's blues
[00:55.08] I've sang enough about myself
[00:57.55] So if you're looking for some bad news
[01:00.20] You can find it somewhere else
[01:15.20] 
[01:03.45] Last year was a son of a bitch
[01:05.72] For nearly everyone we know
[01:09.40] But I ain't fighting with you down in a ditch
[01:11.85] I'll meet you up here on the road
[01:28.35] 
[01:15.07] I know you're tired
[01:17.93] And you ain't sleeping well
[01:21.62] Uninspired
[01:23.25] And likely mad as hell
[01:26.65] But wherever you are
[01:28.51] I hope the high road leads you home again
[01:32.26] To a world you want to live in
[01:47.26] 
[01:37.40] We'll ride the ship down
[01:40.04] Dumping buckets overboard
[01:47.39] There can't be more of them than us
[01:52.88] There can't be more
[02:02.38] 
[02:18.73] I know you're tired
[02:21.26] And you ain't sleeping well
[02:24.64] Uninspired
[02:26.59] And likely mad as hell
[02:29.65] But wherever you are
[02:31.60] I hope the high road leads you home again
[02:35.90] To a world you want to live in
[02:41.08] To a world you want to live in
