[00:26.77] I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
[00:33.28] You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
[00:39.29] May you never take one single breath for granted
[00:45.70] God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
[00:51.63] I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
[00:58.77] Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
[01:05.06] Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
[01:11.46] And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
[01:36.46] 
[01:17.31] I hope you dance
[01:23.64] I hope you dance
[01:31.64] 
[01:30.02] I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
[01:36.77] Never settle for the path of least resistance
[01:43.21] Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
[01:49.55] Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
[01:55.78] Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter
[02:02.03] When you come close to sellin' out, reconsider
[02:08.19] Give the Heavens above more than just a passing glance
[02:15.05] And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
[02:40.05] 
[02:20.66] I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
[02:27.91] I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
[02:33.48] I hope you dance (Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder)
[02:40.57] I hope you dance (Where those years have gone?)
[03:04.07] 
[02:46.19] I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
[02:53.01] Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
[02:58.90] Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
[03:05.72] And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
[03:30.72] 
[03:12.09] Dance
[03:18.16] I hope you dance
[03:23.92] I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
[03:31.03] I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
[03:36.55] I hope you dance (Tell me who wants to look back on their years and wonder)
[03:43.80] I hope you dance (Where those years have gone?)
[04:07.30] 
[03:50.11] Tell me who wants to look back on their years
[03:54.74] And wonder where those years have gone
