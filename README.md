Hope
I'm on my way, I'm coming
Don't, don't lose faith in me
I know you've been waitin'
I know you've been prayin'
for my soul
Hope, hope
Thirty years you been draggin'
your feet
Tellin' me I'm the reason
we're stagnant
Thirty years you've been
claimin' your rightness
And promisin' progress,
but where's it at?
I don't want you
to feel like a failure (Failure)
I know this hurts (Hurts)
But I gave you
your chance to deliver
Now it's my turn
Don't get me wrong,
Nate you've had a great run
But it's time to give the people
somethin' different
So without further ado,
I'd like to introduce my
My album, my album, my album,
my album, my album, my album
Hope
What's my definition of success?
Listening to
what your heart says
Standing up for what you know is
Right, while everybody else is
Tucking their tail
between their legs (Okay)
What's my definition of success?
Creating something
no one else can
Bein' brave enough to dream big
Grindin' when you're told
to just quit
Givin' more
when you got nothin' left
It's a person
that'll take a chance on
Somethin' they were told
could never happen
It's a person that can see
the bright side through
the dark times
when there ain't one
It's when someone
who ain't never had nothin'
Ain't afraid to walk away from
more profit
'Cause they'd rather do
somethin' that they really love
and take the paycut
It's a person
that would never waiver
Or change who they are
Just to try
and gain some credibility
So they could feel accepted
by a stranger
It's a person that can take
the failures in their life
and turn them into motivation
It's believing in yourself
when no one else does,
it's amazing
What a little bit of faith
can do
if you don't even believe in you
Why would you think or expect
anybody else
that's around you to?
I done did things that I regret
I done said things
I can't take back
Was a lost soul at a cross road
who had no hope
but I changed that
I spent years of my life
holdin' on to things
I never should've kept,
full of hatred
Years of my life carryin'
a lot of baggage that
I should've walked away from
Years of my life wishin'
I was someone different,
lookin' for some validation
Years of my life tryna
fill the void,
pretending I was in-
They get it
Growing pain's a necessary evil
Difficult to go through, yes,
but beneficial
Some would say having a mental
breakdown is a negative thing
which on one hand I agree with
On the other hand,
it was the push I needed to get
help and start
the healing process, see
If I'd have never hit
rock bottom
Would I be the person
that I am today?
I don't believe so
I'm a prime example of
what happens
when you choose to
not accept defeat
and face your demons
Took me thirty years to realize
that if you want to
get the opportunity to be
the greatest version of yourself
Sometimes you got to be someone
you're not to hear
the voice of reason
Having kids will make you
really take a step back
and look in the mirror
At least for me
that's what it did, I
Wake up every day
and pick my son up
Hold him in my arms
And let him know he's loved
(Loved)
Standing by the window
questioning
if dad is ever going to show up
(Up)
Isn't something he's goin' to
have to worry about
Don't get it twisted,
that wasn't a shot
Mama I forgive you
I just don't want him to grow up
thinkin' that
he'll never be enough
Thirty years of running,
thirty years of searching
Thirty years of hurting,
thirty years of pain
Thirty years of fearful,
thirty years of anger
Thirty years of empty,
thirty years of shame
Thirty years of broken,
thirty years of anguish
Thirty years of hopeless,
thirty years of (hey)
Thirty years of never,
thirty years of maybe
Thirty years of later,
thirty years of fake
Thirty years of hollow,
thirty years of sorrow
Thirty years of darkness,
thirty years of (Nate)
Thirty years of baggage,
thirty years of sadness
Thirty years of stagnant,
thirty years of chains
Thirty years of anxious,
thirty years of suffering
Thirty years of torment,
thirty years of (wait)
Thirty years of bitter,
thirty years of lonely
Thirty years of pushing
everyone away
You'll never evolve,
I know I can change
We are not enough,
we are not the same
You don't have the heart,
you don't have the strength
You don't have the will,
you don't have the faith
You'll never be loved,
you'll never be safe
Might as well give up,
not running away
You don't have the guts,
you're the one afraid
I'm the one in charge
I'm taking the- (No)
I'm taking the
Reins
